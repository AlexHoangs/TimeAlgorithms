# TimeAlgorithms
Created a program that measures the run-time of different types of sort algorithms and prints each one in CSVformat to compare efficiency.
Utilized json.h extension to read into a JSON file, edit, and print out necessary/requested information.
Allowed multiple file inputs to read different JSON files and print output differences in JSON format.
